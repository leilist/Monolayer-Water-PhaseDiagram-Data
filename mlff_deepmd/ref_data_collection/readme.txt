cp2k.inp is a energy-force calculation script to obtain DFT data for training by cp2k.
geometry.xyz is an example of the atomic configuration needed by cp2k.inp.

Three files, i.e. BASIS_MOLOPT, GTH_POTENTIALS, vdW_kernel_table.dat, are also needed by cp2k.inp. These files can be found in the data directory of cp2k installation directory.
